## Introduction

Wine is no doubt an important constituent of western culture. It is common to see a long list of wines on restaurant menus or wine as a gift on celebration occasions. However, as ordinary people without prior exposure to wine knowledge, we may feel dazzled by all sorts of wine names in wine stores or restaurants and confused about different winesâ€™ styles and tastes. 

We want to use data visualization techniques to reveal some interesting facts about wine and evaluate wine varieties with multiple dimensions. Geographical visualization, network visualization, radar chart, and radial tree diagram are utilized to display patterns from unique perspectives. Wine enthusiasts may also benefit from our interactive visualization feature by discovering wines suitable for their own taste preferences.

## Visualization 

In total, we have 4 sets of visualization - **Wine map, Taste radar, Grape-style Chord, Food pair network**. The adjustable navigation bar is on the left side of the webpage. The user can click on each row to switch the view, and the default page is Wine map.
